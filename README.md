# HierbaNetV1_Sorghum_Weed_Classifier
'HierbaNetV1_Sorghum_Weed_Classifier' is an artificial intelligence (AI) based software that can differentiate a sorghum sampling image from its associated weeds images. This model is built on 'HierbaNetV1' - a novel Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) architecture. The working of the architecture is detailed in the video article published in 'Science Talks' - Elsevier journal, which can be accessed via the URL https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2772569324000240

## HierbaNetV1 architecture
### Ideation of HierbaNetV1
The idea of HierbaNetV1 is to perform intensive feature extraction from each data sample focusing on multiple levels of complexity, irrespective of the ROI size, and emphasize low-level features consistently.
